w4118_sh
==
Simple bash-like shell.

## Project structure

include/path_utils.h: Header file
Makefile: Slightly modified Makefile to fit my structure
scripts/checkpatch.pl: Format checking script
src/path_utils.c: Helpers for manipulation of path variable
src/shell.c: Implementation of shell (main)
tests/test.py: Test suite

## Workflow

Compile: make
Check structure: make clean
Run tests: cd tests; python ./test.py
Run shell: ./w4118_sh

## Notes
Signal SIGINT handling imlemented: The parent ignores
SIGINT while there are running children. As soon as all
his children terminated SIGINT handling is reseted to
default.

Support for quotes in commands: Commands like grep "PATTERN" [FILE...]
have support for quotes; e.g., grep "l" README will search character l,
not "l".
